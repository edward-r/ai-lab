# Lab 24 — Capstone: Two‑Page Mini‑Paper

**Goal:** Synthesize your learning into a concise write‑up that others can replicate.

## Deliverables (2 pages max)
- **Title + Abstract (≤120 words)**
- **Methods:** dataset, seed, activation, η, epochs, τ‑selection method
- **Results:** a small table of metrics + 1–2 annotated screenshots
- **Discussion:** what worked, what failed, what you’d try next
- **Repro Notes:** steps to reproduce

## Suggested Topics
- “Picking τ for high‑recall under label noise”
- “Comparing step vs sigmoid under class imbalance”
- “How η shapes the learning curve on separable data”

## Format
Use `docs/templates/mini-paper-template.md` as a starting point; keep it concise and reader‑friendly.

## Evaluation (see rubric)
- Clarity, correctness, reproducibility, and use of Sim visuals.

## Expected outcomes
- A credible, tight explainer that stands on its own and can be reproduced by a peer.
