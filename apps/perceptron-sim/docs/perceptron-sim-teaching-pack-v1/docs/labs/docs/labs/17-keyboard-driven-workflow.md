# Lab 17 — Keyboard-driven workflow (a11y & speed)

**Goal:** Use shortcuts to stay focused on the canvas.

## Setup
- Any dataset.

## Actions
- **Space** start/pause, **N** step once (paused), **R** reset, **S** save snapshot.
- Practice a cycle: Reset → Space (train) → Space (pause) → S (save) → N (fine-tune).

## Observe
- Less mouse travel; you stay in the “visual loop.”

## Why it matters
- Fast iteration helps build intuition and reduces context switching.

## Expected outcomes
- You can replicate a training path faster and more consistently.
