# Lab 16 — Snapshot storytelling (init → mid → final)

**Goal:** Use overlays to tell the learning story.

## Setup
- Dataset: **Separable** (clean) then **Noisy** (harder).

## Actions
1. Save **init**; train **N** steps; save **mid**; train more; save **final**.
2. Overlay all three and narrate the motion (rotate vs translate).

## Observe
- Clean: smooth rotation/translation toward the optimum.
- Noisy: final line compromises between clusters.

## Why it matters
- Overlays make abstract “convergence” concrete and memorable.

## Expected outcomes
- Clean overlays show a clear path; noisy overlays show a compromise.
